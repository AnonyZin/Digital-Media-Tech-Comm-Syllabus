## Course Description

This course serves as a resource in building professional skills and knowledge for navigating the academic and alt-ac job market, preparing a portfolio of work, and pursuing academic publication. As it is a 0-credit course, there are no assessment-focused grades: the four modules target documents, marked for completion only, with an emphasis on opportunities for feedback and reflection.

Each module will consist of:

- **Readings, Lecture, and Sample Documents.** Readings are all open access or available through the UCF library. Each lecture will contextualize a different aspect of the job search.
- **Assignment for Document Draft.** Throughout the semester, students will submit four draft documents: a CV, research statement, teaching statement, and cover letter. These can be targeted and altered to suit individual goals.
- **Optional Live Workshop.** Live workshops will be scheduled based on the results of the course survey, and will be conducted on Zoom.

## Course Objectives

- Assess job postings to understand requirements and expectations, and prepare job market materials and assess their own strengths, weaknesses, and goals
- Discuss academic and alt-ac job market challenges including marketing, navigating transdisciplinary departments, interviewing, and salary negotiation
- Receive feedback on publication and portfolio goals, and understand how to prioritize and handle academic publishing
- Identify their individual challenges and opportunities, and receive mentoring on how to best reach their career goals
- Think broadly about potential future directions, both within and outside traditional research venues and institutions

## Materials and Texts

The primary text for this class is available through the UCF library as an unlimited user ebook:

- Julia Miller Vick, Jennifer S. Furlong, and Rosanne Lurie. [*The Academic Job Search Handbook.*](https://ucf-flvc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01FALSC_UCF/rh57g9/cdi_proquest_ebookcentral_EBC4540334)
  
In addition, each module includes samples and additional recommended readings.

## Evaluation and Grading

This course has no formal grading: as a zero-credit course, it relies on milestone completion only. Students will complete and submit for feedback:

- Academic Activity Verification
- Draft CV
- Research Statement
- Teaching Statement
- Cover Letter

## Asynchronous Online Course Structure

This course uses a fully asynchronous online format, and relies upon students to complete all readings, engage with both course lectures and other online videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments are marked for completion only, but for the best feedback, complete work by the recommended dates in each module.

The course has no synchronous meeting requirements: however, students are encouraged to engage in the four optional workshops if feasible. Workshops will be scheduled based on the poll conducted in the first week of classes. Office hour assistance is additionally available both through text on Webcourses messages and via Zoom.

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/) defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and decisions.

1. Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2. Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3. Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4. Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5. Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF’s Rules of Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According to Section 1, “Academic Misconduct,” students are prohibited from engaging in

1. Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material also constitutes cheating.
2. Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else’s efforts and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3. Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a third-party vendor without authorization or without the express written permission of the university and the instructor. Course materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor’s PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4. Falsifying or misrepresenting the student’s own academic work.
5. Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another’s work without any indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the impression that such work is the student’s own.
6. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit more than once without the express written permission of the instructor.
7. Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8. Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for academic misconduct in UCF’s student handbook, [The Golden Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a responsibility for students’ education and the value of a UCF degree, and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to an “F” letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred suspension or separation from the University through suspension, dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a “Z” designation on one’s transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials, assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for assistance, and know that additional support is always available regardles of documentation.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities. Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185, sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Land Acknowledgement Statement

The UCF Department of English acknowledges that our main campus stands on the traditional territories of the Seminole and Timucua peoples, and that other Native American traditional territories exist throughout Florida where our regional campuses are located. We collectively recognize their continuing connection to the land, water, and air and pay respect to their elders past, present, and emerging. We recognize the continuing consequences of colonialism on Indigenous peoples and their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and we fully endorse Indigenous Sovereignty.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class, everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

- In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
- Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide’s physical location and review the [online version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
- Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an emergency.
- If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To learn where those are located, see [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
- To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and logging in. Click on “Student Self Service” located on the left side of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue “Personal Information” heading on the Student Center screen, click on “UCF Alert”, fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell phone number, and cell phone provider, click “Apply” to save the changes, and then click “OK.”
- Students with special needs related to emergency situations should speak with their instructors outside of class.
- To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus or elsewhere, consider viewing this [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity (for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).
